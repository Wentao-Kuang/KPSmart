This project was done during study at Victoria University of Wellington with a team of five people. 
We experienced a scrum process model during the development of the KPS. We performed the requirement
analysis together then seperated to do different roles. I was mainly resposible for the database design
and model layer. I also finished some functions in the control layer. Two other members were responsible
for the GUI,the last one is the logic control layer, and the last one is documentation and testing.
